## HTML + CSS task

The purpose of this task was:

>By using **only** HTML and CSS, create a responsive list identical to the one in attached designs. Appearance of the list should change depending on screen width (like on designs) and number of elements (eg. after removing one random element from HTML body, others should also automatically change - see "5 elements" design).<br /><br />
The task should be done in **one** HTML file (with css in "<style>" element). <br /><br />
**Used font:** Arial <br />
**Used colors:** #FFFF99, #EEEEEE, #999999, #666666, #000000 <br /><br />
Attached **designs** represent examples of various screen width and number of elements
(check file names). Since designs are in png format, make sure that you are displaying
them in their original size (1:1 / 100%) without zooming or scaling by your image browser.
